File Read & Write Challenge with Error Handling
ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This program allows you to:

Read the contents of a file provided by the user

Modify the contents (convert text to UPPERCASE)

Save the modified version into a new file (modified_<filename>)

Handle errors gracefully (missing files, permission errors, unexpected issues)


How to Run

Save the code above in a file named file_reader.py.

Prepare a text file (e.g., notes.txt) in the same folder.

Run the script in your terminal:

python file_reader.py


Enter the name of the text file when prompted.

A new file will be created with the modified content, e.g., modified_notes.txt.
